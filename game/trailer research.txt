Teaser after game trailer:
dissolve in from static, fade in from static noise
start music so that the first drum hits the first line of text
text is white or lavender when on black
noise between the parts that are not directly connected?
characters zoom in while panning into the different sides
first air zooms in from center to left side of the screen, text on the right side
then sil zooms in from center to right, text on left side
it would be best if they could change expressions in the middle of zooming and moving?
the background behindthe logo could be darker maybe?
the logo fades into noise and maybe into black as well?
